How ShopSmart AI Works (Step-by-Step Workflow)

1. User Interaction (Frontend)

The customer interacts via chatbox, WhatsApp, or SMS.

They ask questions like “Where is my order?” or “Suggest a budget-friendly laptop.”

2. AI Processing (Backend & LLM)

The chatbot forwards the query to the Flask backend.

The LLM (Mistral 7B) processes the request, determines intent, and fetches relevant data.

3. Response Generation

If the query is about a product, the chatbot retrieves product details from the database.

If it’s an order-related query, the chatbot fetches tracking details from the system.

For general inquiries, the chatbot uses its AI knowledge to generate a human-like response.

4. Delivering the Response

The chatbot formats and sends the response back to the user.

Users can continue the conversation seamlessly, as the chatbot retains context.

5. Continuous Learning & Improvement

The chatbot analyzes past interactions to improve response accuracy over time.

Admins can train new FAQs and features to keep the AI updated.

Why Use an LLM Like Mistral 7B?

Without an LLM (Large Language Model), the chatbot would be rule-based, meaning it would:

 Only respond to predefined questions – No flexibility in understanding new queries.
 Struggle with complex interactions – Unable to understand intent variations.
 Require constant manual updates – Developers must add responses manually.
 Lack conversational flow – No ability to hold context-aware discussions.

By using Mistral 7B, ShopSmart AI delivers dynamic, intelligent, and engaging interactions that feel more natural and human-like.
